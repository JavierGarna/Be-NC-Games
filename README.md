## Create the enviroment variables

We'll have two databases in this project. One for real looking dev data and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
